My familiarity with recursive functions ends after the classic Fibonacci sequence or counter example. I found myself asking okay but when am I _actually_ going to use this? There must be a time were recursion will shine and I can't just brute force my way through with a for loop.... right? \n\n\nEnter hierarchical data. Let's say you have hierarchical data represented in a flat structure. Here we have elements with an id, that each have a parent element. At the highest level we have body which doesn't have a parent element, but both `hand` and `foot` have the `body` parent. Then `finger` has the parent `hand` and `toe` the parent `foot`. Let's structure this data as a tree to represent these relationships better!\n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\nlet anatomy = [\n { id: 'body',   parent: null },\n { id: 'hand',   parent: 'body' },\n { id: 'ring finger', parent: 'hand' },\n { id: 'pinky', parent: 'hand' },\n { id: 'foot',   parent: 'body' },\n { id: 'big toe',    parent: 'foot' }\n]\n```\n\n## The recursive function\n\nThe logic behind our recursive function is that we need a function that will filter for each unique parent, then look for all the id's that share that parent. Then the recursive function calls itself in order to make those id's the next level's parents:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\nlet makeTree = (categories, parent) => {\n  // create a variable we can manipulate\n  let node = {}\n  \n  categories\n     // get the root parent (supplied in function as arg)\n    .filter(c => c.parent === parent)\n     // get all the ids with the specified parent\n    .forEach(c => node[c.id] = \n      // now make this same tree, \n      // but here we use the current id as the parent\n      makeTree(categories, c.id))\n  // the variable we manipulate is our output\n  return node\n}\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(makeTree(anatomy, null)), null, 2)\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\n{\n  body: {\n    hand: {\n      \"ring finger\": {},\n      \"pinky\":{}\n    },\n    foot: {\n      \"big toe\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the first loop, we pass in our object, `anatomy` and also pass in the root parent: `null`. For every body part we use `forEach` to assign the node (`body`) and give it the return value of the same function, but this time we're not passing in `anatomy`, we've passed in `body` so it will return `hand` and `foot` - and we recurse down assigning all fingers to hand and toes to feet. This recursion happens all the way down until there are not properties left to assign.\n\nThis tree structure makes it quite obvious that body contains both hand and foot, which contains finger and toe respectively. A little more practical than the Fibonacci sequence example if you ask me... \n\n## Translating into R:\n\nI wanted to translate this function into #rstats and of course Twitter came through. With the help of [Jakub T. Jankiewicz]([https://twitter.com/jcubic) we can translate this function above into #rstats using applys!\n\n\n#### Given this list of lists:\n\n```{r}\nanatomy <- list(\n  list(id = 'body', parent = NULL),\n  list(id = 'hand', parent = 'body'),\n  list(id = 'ring finger', parent = 'hand'),\n  list(id = 'pinky', parent = 'hand'),\n  list(id = 'foot', parent = 'body'),\n  list(id = 'big toe', parent = 'foot')\n)\n```\n\n#### We can make our recursive function\n\nWe can create an empty list and filter it based on the selected parent argument. We use this same argument and assign it as the node id, then run the `makeTree` function on that node again, going deeper and deeper into the tree\n\n```{r}\nmakeTree <- function(categories, parent) {\n  node <- list()\n  filtered <- sapply(categories, function(c) {\n    identical(c$parent, parent)\n  })\n  lapply(categories[filtered], function(c) {\n    node[[c$id]] <<- makeTree(categories, c$id)\n  })\n  node\n}\n\nmakeTree(anatomy, NULL)\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../inst/css/styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","pagetitle":"Maya Gans","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Recursion again and again and again","author":"Maya Gans","date":"2021-08-30","description":"Trying to understand recursion by explaining it.","categories":["JavaScript"],"image":"featured.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
