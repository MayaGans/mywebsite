<h1>MAYA GANS</h1>
<p>Data Visualization Engineer</p>
</section>

  
<section class="intro section">
<p>I graduated from the University of Wyoming with my Masterâ€™s in Science May 2019. My thesis was on the bacterial communities of a parasitic plant and how it interacts with fungi and adjacent trees. Working in ecology provided the foundation for studying complex, interconnected networks. My interests shifted from my study system to the statistical methods needed to model complex interactions and large datasets. After completing my degree, I worked at RStudio as an Intern where I created tidyblocks.tech, a blocks-based coding language to teach high school statistical students the fundamentals of programming. 

After my internship I have been applying my R and JavaScript skills as a web developer in the clinical trial space.</p>
