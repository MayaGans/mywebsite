I'm always trying to sharpen my JavaScript skills and I thought a good way of doing this would be to turn some dataframes I had lying around into JavaScript arrays of objects. What resulted is a love letter to the little R functions that are in actuality powerhouses and make our lives so easy because the best way I've seen to write these in JavaScript is, well, cray.

## `seq`

In R the seq function lets us create a sequence of numbers by specifying where to start and where to finish. Done.

In JavaScript, the most concise way I've found to do this is create an empty array of the length of your sequence, spread it using `...` so you get keys for each item, and then extract those keys to get a sequence of numbers!

<div class="split-container">
<div class="left">

```{r}
(r_arr <- seq(0,10))
```
    
</div>
