With a little bit of JQuery, the JavaScript function `Shiny.setInputValue` lets you take any HTML element and make it a Shiny `input` which I'll display here using a div called `all_circles` which contains three circles. Think of `all_circles` as a widget like `selectInput`, the circles themselves would then be the same as setting `choices`.

```{#r}
selectInput("inputID", "Name to Display", choices = c("Red Circle", "Yellow Circle", "Blue Circle"))
```

Because we can envision use cases to be beyond clicking on simple shapes, I wanted to use `SVGs`, which was my first learning curve.

```{html}
<svg class="circ" height="100" width="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle id ='circ_red' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='red'/>
</svg>
```

Note that the svg class is `circ` and the circle has the unique id `circ_red`. Repeating this code two more times but changing the fill to `blue` and `yellow` and the circle ids to `circ_blue` and `circ_yellow` yeilds three circles, all of the same class but with their own unique ids:

<div class="text-center">
<svg class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
<circle id ='circ_red' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='red'/>
</svg>

<svg id ='circ_blue' class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
<circle id ='circ_blue' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='blue' />
</svg>

<svg id ='circ_yellow'class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
<circle id ='circ_yellow' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='yellow'/>
</svg>
</div>

Shiny can take on a lot of HTML tags, but I found to properly render SVGs I needed to add a `uiOutput` to the UI portion of the app

```
div(id="all_circles", uiOutput("svgout")),
```

And put the SVG code in a reactive within the server:

```
 output$svgout <- renderUI({
    HTML(
      "<svg class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
        <circle id ='circ_red' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='red'/>
      </svg>
      <svg id ='circ_blue' class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
        <circle id ='circ_blue' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='blue' />
      </svg>
      <svg id ='circ_yellow'class='circ' height='100' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
        <circle id ='circ_yellow' cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='black' stroke-width='3' fill='yellow'/>
      </svg>"
    )
  })
}
```

Note that I wrapped the SVG within a div called `all_circles` - this is the div that will act as our `selectInput`.

## JavaScript Time!

In the next little chunk of code we use JQuery to go into the div of class `all_circles` and find the id of the `circ` class that was clicked on. We can then take that id and assign it as the value of the shiny input `all_circles`.

```
  tags$script(HTML(
    "$('#all_circles').on('click', '.circ', (ev) => {
        Shiny.setInputValue('all_circles', ev.target.id)
        })
        "
  ))
```

And there you have it! The `#` denotes that we're looking for an id and the `.` a class name. We're using a callback function to get the id of the clicked svg, which you can learn more about in some of my prior blog posts.
By adding `verbatimTextOutput("debug")` and in the server `input$debug <- renderText(input$all_circles)` you'll see that the input changes from red to yellow to blue on click! 

My revelation to set custom Shiny inputs was an incredibly powerful one that I needed to share, as it enables assigning whatever you want as an input with only a little bit of JQuery to find the elements you want to set as your `choices`. For instance, I used [This opensource library of a human body made fully with CSS and SVGs](https://github.com/volcanioo/Human-Body-Rendering-HTML) to create a `div` called `human_body`, then made the "choices" each of the body part SVGs. I hope this opens up new ways of exploring and interacting with data as it did for me!!
